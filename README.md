# Automate-Secret-Santa-Emails
Secret Santa Rules

Here's the version of Secret Santa:

Each person will be assigned another random person via an auto-generated email.
Once everyone is assigned a person, they will buy a gift for that person.
The group will exchange gifts on a chosen day!
This project tackles auto-generating Secret Santa emails using a tool called SMTP.
